The bachelor's thesis topic for college involves creating a website using NodeJs and ReactJs.
The project aims to develop an online veterinary pharmacy for the purchase of pharmaceutical products for animals.
The necessary files can be downloaded, and with Node installed on a personal computer, it is possible to run a local instance of the website.
For more information on running the application, please refer to the following document:
